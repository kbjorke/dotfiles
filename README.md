# Dotfiles

**Made by:** *Kristian Bj√∏rke*

## Introduction:

This repository consists the dotfiles that I have customized for my use and 
would like to keep and continue to develop. At the current time the content 
of this repository is mainly focused on my Gnome Terminal environment, 
through the bashrc file, and my Vim terminal text editor. At a later time
I might add other dotfiles, if there are some other customizations that I
would like to preserve.

This README.md file is made to explain the important features of my 
customization. Primarily so that I have an overview of the features without 
having to read through every dotfiles. Secondarily for other poeple wanting 
to understand my settings and customization.

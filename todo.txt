# List containing things I would like to implement in my dotfiles:

- Maybe change to a better colorscheme, current one to dark compared
  to web browser. (perhaps ok?)
- Add commandline argument feature to makesymlink.sh script.
- Make it possible to git push without writing in my username every time,
  still want to input password, though.
- Explore the possibilies of suing git alliases in .gitconfig, maybe include
  this file in the dotfiles.

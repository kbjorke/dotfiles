# List containing things I would like to implement in my dotfiles:

- Make a satisfying way in vim to copy and paste from/to clipboard.
- Maybe change to a better colorscheme, current one to dark compared
  to web browser. (perhaps ok?)
- Add commandline argument feature to makesymlink.sh script.
- Make backup command/alias to copy all MSc files to my home area on
  HPC or phys network.
